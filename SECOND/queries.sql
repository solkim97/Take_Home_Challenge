What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?
Assumption 1: We only look at users where BIRTH_DATE is available
Assumption 2: All available BIRTH_DATE data is accurate
Assumption 3: We are not counting duplicate receipts (have the same RECEIPT_ID)
Assumption 4: Users have to be 21 or over as of the date, 3/4/24 (this is the CURRENT_DATE)
Assumption 5: There are 2 brands with 3 receipts and 6 brands with 2 receipts. To get top 5, we are using the RANK function, 
              not DENSE_RANK
ANSWER: 1. DOVE - 3
        1. NERDS CANDY -3
        3. SOUR PATCH KIDS - 2
        3. MEIJER - 2

/* What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?
Assumption 1: This is based on final sales from transactions in unique RECEIPT_IDs
Assumption 2: To remove duplicate RECEIPT_IDs, we keep the highest FINAL_SALE value
Assumption 3: Because we have a clear Top 5 based on final_sale amounts, using LIMIT 5 instead of a RANK function
ANSWER: 1. CVS - $72.00
        2.	DOVE - $30.91
